# fizzbuzz
Sample solutions to the [FizzBuzz kata](https://codingdojo.org/kata/FizzBuzz/)

Three solutions to the kata in three tagged commits:

+ simple: the solution to the initial version.

+ stage2: adds the new requirement (use Fizz or Buzz also when the number contains a 3 or a 5).

+ generalized: generalizes the checks using a list with conditions.
